# Mini-Project-on-Graph-Embeddings181

This is a readme file for Mini Project on Low-Distortion Embedding by me in Ben Gurion University in 2018. 

The Mini Project is Based on the paper "On Sparse Spanners of Weighted Graphs" by Ingo Althofer and implements the graph spaning algorithm described in it.

Supervisor: Prof. Michael Elkin


Operating instructions:
Lets say the folder Mini_P is in the path:    ".../Mini_P" then in order to compile and run the program:
Open intelliJ idea and click open.
Choose ".../Mini_P" as the path for the project to be opened
Run the project.

During the lanch of the program the following will be printed on the screen:

"Whould you like to run default tests or run costumed tests to your liking?
Enter d for default, c for costumed tests"

If you press d, then the tests I ran will run again.
If you choose c, you can pick an aspect to test and give it the parameters to your liking. 

The results of every test are written into csv files, and during the tests some relevant printing will accure.
Note that, if you run a costumed test, when you enter the name of the file you want the result to be written in you  need to write the file with the ending, i.e.
"output.csv" and not "output". also , if you want to you can open it as a text file via ending of .txt.

If you pressed d, then the results will be in the following files:
edgesAspectExp1.csv
edgesAspectExp2.csv
avarageEdgeDiff1.csv
avarageEdgeDiff2.csv
weightsAspectExpirement1.csv
weightsAspectExpirement2.csv
weightsAspectExpirement3.csv 


Note: the files above already exist in the folder Minii_P from previous tests.
